# S37: THE 2025-2026 REGULARITY FRONTIER

Following the verification of the **Stretching Majorant** in S35/S36, we are now exploring active "Alternative Angles" from the modern mathematical horizon (2024-2026 research).

## 1. Angle Alpha: The Rigidity Perspective (Kenig-Merle)
- **Source**: Torah Sanni / Joseph Thomas Cox (Nov 2025).
- **Core Idea**: If a singularity exists, there must be a "Minimal Ancient Profile" that is scale-invariant. One rules this out using:
    - **Pressure-Smart Localized Energy Inequalities**: Using a "harmonic flux corrector" to handle the non-local pressure terms.
    - **Backward Uniqueness**: Proving that the only solution that stays "small" for all time is the zero solution.
- **Audit Path**: Can our graph model exhibit "Backward Uniqueness"? If we start at a "Singular Topology" and run the clock backward, does it necessarily dissipate?

## 2. Angle Beta: Emergent Nonlinear Vorticity Dissipation
- **Source**: Andrei Polozov (July 2025).
- **Core Idea**: In regions of extreme vorticity, the standard viscous term $-\nu \Delta u$ effectively behaves as a **nonlinear damping** term (e.g., $L_{diss} \sim |\omega|^\alpha$).
- **The "Brake" Mechanism**: This damping suppresses vortex stretching *before* it can reach the $O(1/r^2)$ singularity.
- **Audit Path**: Modify the `malicious_voyager` and `pressure_coordinator` models to include an "Emergent Damping" term. Check if this kills the $C \approx 0.05$ ratio entirely.

## 3. Angle Gamma: Sundman-style Time Lifting
- **Source**: J. Camlin (Dec 2025).
- **Core Idea**: Use a "Sundman Transformation" (adapted from the N-body problem) to regularize the time variable.
- **Mechanism**: Define a new time variable $\tau$ such that $dt = \frac{d\tau}{\Phi(\omega)}$, where $\Phi$ is a vorticity-response functional. This "stretches" the singularity into an infinite time-horizon.
- **Audit Path**: Implement a "Sundman Solver" for the interaction of two vortex filaments. Does the "singular point" become an attractor or a repeller in the lifted time-domain?

## 4. Angle Delta: The AI-Singularity Search (PINNs)
- **Source**: Google DeepMind / ETH Zurich (2025).
- **Core Idea**: Use Physics-Informed Neural Networks to "learn" the blow-up geometry by minimizing the residual of the NSE.
- **Finding**: PINNs often find "near-singularities" that are eventually regularized by the non-local pressure.
- **Audit Path**: Use our "Malicious Voyager" as a toy PINN. We have already shown that "Malice" (Optimization) is bounded by the Stretching Majorant.
